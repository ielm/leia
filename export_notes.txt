The following knowledge was intentionally omitted during export for various reasons:

air-1: is only used by breathe-2
breathe-2: is not used by anything
wheel-1: is not used by anything
obstruct-2: is not used by anything
seat-1: is not used by anything

motion-event-1: theme/sem/obstruct.theme doesn't make sense (and we don't have dot notation support currently)
