LEIA suite Installation instructions:


1) All LEIA code required is in this LEIA project repository; no other sources are needed.
2) Requires Python 3.9+.
3) Install all libraries and data sources in the requirements.txt file.  It is recommended that you do this in
   a virtual environment.
    - python3 -m venv .virtualenvs/leia
    - source .virtualenvs/leia/bin/activate
    - pip install -r requirements.txt
4) The benepar constituency parser requires some NLTK data that cannot be put into the pip installation.
   Make a location for NLTK data, and then manually install the needed content.
    - source .virtualenvs/leia/bin/activate
    - mkdir .nltkdata
    - export NLTK_DATA=.nltkdata
    - python3
        import benepar
        benepar.download("benepar_en3")


When running any process:


1) Be sure to switch to the virutal environment (if used):
    - source .virtualenvs/leia/bin/activate
2) Be sure to set the NLTK_DATA environment variable if syntax processing is needed:
    - export NLTK_DATA=.nltkdata
