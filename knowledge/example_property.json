/*
  Valid types:
    relation        This is a relation; its ranges must be concepts
    case-role       This is a special set of relations (that are just "more important")
    literal         This is a literal attribute; its ranges will always be strings
    scalar          This is a scalar attribute; its ranges will always be numbers
    boolean         This is a boolean attribute; its ranges will always be booleans
  Valid ranges:
    [@object, $prop, ...]   A list of one or more concepts or properties (for relations / case-roles)
    [str, str, ...]         A list of string values (for literals)
    [comparator, #, #],     A numeric range; second number is optional (per comparator); for scalars
                            Comparators are: >, >=, <, <=, ><, >=<
    !AnyLit                 A special identifier for "any literal is valid"; for literals
    !AnyNum                 A special identifier for "any number is valid"; for scalars
    !AnyType                A special identifier for "any concept or property is valid"; for relations / case-roles
    !AnyBool                A special identifier for "any boolean is valid"; for booleans
  Inverse:          Valid only on relations / case-roles
  Measured-in:      Valid only on scalars; must be part of the @measuring-unit concept subtree
