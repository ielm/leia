  "def": "(from Wikipedia) decibel (dB) is a logarithmic unit of measurement that expresses the magnitude of a physical quantity (usually power or intensity) relative to a specified or implied reference level. Since it expresses a ratio of two quantities with the same unit, it is a dimensionless unit. In 2003 the International Committee for Weights and Measures decided not to adopt the decibel as an SI unit.",
