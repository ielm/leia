/*
  The name field can be any string that is unique amongst transformations.
  The example is any human-readable example that demonstrates a sentence that the transformation would trigger on.

  The pattern field consists of two subfields:
    vars: a dictionary whose keys are integers (as strings) and whose values are dictionaries with:
      pos: a list of possible parts of speech for a particular variable
      tag: a list of possible additional tags to match for a particular variable
    syn-strucs: a list of individual syn-strucs, any of which can act as a match for this transformation;
                each entry uses the same format as the lexicon sense's syn-struc (although "root" should be excluded)

  The executable is a pointer to the python implementation of this transformation.
    The full module path must be given.
    The string may start with an * (this is just to operate as a reminder that this is essentially a pointer).
    The executable need not be implemented yet - the system will skip the transformation if it is not available,
      and will record a warning in that case.
