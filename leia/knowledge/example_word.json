/*
  The senses field can have any number of senses in it (only one is shown above).

  SENSE:              the full unique id of the sense; WORD-CAT#; e.g., MAN-N1
  WORD:               the root word; e.g., MAN
  CAT:                the part of speech; e.g., N
  DEF:                a human readable definition of the sense
  EX:                 an example of the word in a sentence
  COMMENTS:           annotator comments
  SYNONYMS:           a list of synonym words; e.g., ["EWE", "RAM"]
  HYPONYMS:           a list of hyponym words; e.g., ["AID", "PHILANTHROPY"]
  SYN-STRUC:          an ordered list of syntactic elements of four types: root, token, dependency, constituency; see below
  SEM-STRUC:          a single concept (e.g., "HUMAN"), or a complex sem-struc form; documented elsewhere
  TMR-HEAD:           null, or a variable string, e.g. "$VAR1"
  MEANING-PROCEDURES: list of MP calls, each a list containing the call and parameters; e.g., [ ["COREFER", "^$VAR1", "^$VAR0"], [...], ... ]
  OUTPUT-SYNTAX:      null, or a POS type (e.g., "N"), or a list of POS types (e.g., ["N", "V"])
  EXAMPLE-DEPS:       list of triples (dependencies); e.g. [ ["NSUBJ", "$VAR0", "$VAR1"], [...], ... ]
  EXAMPLE-BINDINGS:   list of strings with optional binding variable numbers; e.g, ["THEY-2", "DEPRECIATED-0", "THE", "STOCK-1"]
  TYPES:              list of types, e.g., ["A", "B", "C"]
  USE-WITH-TYPES:     list of types to use with, e.g., ["A", "B", "C"]

  The synstruc field is an ordered list of four types of syntactic elements; they are:

  root                this is a shorthand for a token with lemma = word, pos = cat, variable = 0, no morphology
  token               representing a single token, it must include either 1+ lemmas, or a non-null pos
    lemma             a list of lemmas to match against; e.g., ["MAN"]
    pos               a single part of speech or null; e.g., "N"
    morph             a dictionary of arbitrary morphology tags (string -> string)
  dependency          representing a single dependency where the governor is the root
    deptype           the type of the dependency; e.g., "subject"
  constituency        representing a single constituency
    contype           the type of constituency; e.g., "VP"
    children          an ordered list of constituencies (making the structure recursive) and tokens (as defined above)

  In addition to the above, all syntactic elements can also have the following fields:
    var               the variable they map to as an integer; e.g., 3 (default is null)
    opt               a boolean signaling the element is optional; e.g., true (default is false)
