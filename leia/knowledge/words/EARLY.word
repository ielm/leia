e.g., for 'the plane arrived early', find when the plane was supposed  to have arrived. if found,         then 'early' means '< anchor-time' (with anchor-time representing the  expected time)     2. find the typical ontologically-specified range of times when a given  activity should occur and         select the first 1/5 (?) of it; e.g., 'they eat dinner early' means that  if dinner is defined in          the ontology as typically occurring between 5 and 8 p.m., then they eat  between 5 and 5:45 (or      thereabouts); it's possible that people use 'early' to mean 'before the  traditional range', but this         is a complexity of how we define the typical range in the ontology - e.g.,  a person might list as         a typical range (sem) '6-7:30' and as (relaxable-to) '5-9'. there's not  much we can do about this         for now.     3. find the series of events that constitute the given script and select the  first [number?] of them;         e.g., if we're talking about writing a book, 'early in the process' might  mean writing the first         chapters or doing research; this is very advanced analysis and might not  be feasible.   if all of these fail, the semantics will be (^$var1 (time (relative-to-norm <=  .4))). up until now we've   used relative-to-norm only for quantifiers, but we need to expand it -- even to  things like 'too'.)
