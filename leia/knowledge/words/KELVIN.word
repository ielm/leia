      "DEF": "The kelvin is the SI base unit for measuring temperature, and is a unit increment of temperature. The Kelvin scale is a thermodynamic (absolute) temperature scale where absolute zero, the theoretical absence of all thermal energy, is zero (0 K). According to this scale absolute zero is 0 K, or -273.15 C; water freezes at 273.15 K, and boils at 373.15 K. ",
