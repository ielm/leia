      "DEF": "(Wikipedia) The SI derived unit of electric resistance. The ohm is defined as the electric resistance between two points of a conductor when a constant potential difference of 1 volt, applied to these points, produces in the conductor a current of 1 ampere, the conductor not being the seat of any electromotive force. kg*m^2*s^-3*A^-2 (^ means power, kg means kilogram, m means meter, s means second, A means ampere, * means multiplication)",
