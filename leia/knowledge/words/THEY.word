      "COMMENTS": "[D] 'they' can have a definite referent (of many types) or it can refer to generalized humans (they say it will rain today). we will use the generalized-human sense if:   1. the category can or must be human, based on selectional restrictions;   2. there is no *very accessible* antecedent available. this means that if the category can or must be human, we need to inspect the list of candidate antecedents and impose on them a more demanding threshold of acceptability than we use in most instances. that is, since we have the option here of not choosing any of them - and using the generalized meaning instead - we're going to be picky. precisely what 'picky' means will require some testing. nb - I'm not dealing, yet, with the matter of using 'they' in reference to a singular 'if someone... they ...' that *should* be edited out of newspaper texts...",
